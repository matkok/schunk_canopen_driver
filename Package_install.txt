Instructions for setting up scunk_canopn_driver package.

# Installing the software #

## The CAN transceiver driver ##

Download a recent version of the driver from the [PEAK-System website](http://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/linux/index.htm). Version 7.15.2 was used at the time these notes were written. Unpack the archive, switch to the unpacked directory and build the driver using the following commands:
(TODO: check if needed)
```
#!shell

make NET=NO_NETDEV_SUPPORT
sudo make install
```

If everything went well, the red diagnostic LED on the CAN transceiver should start blinking (TODO: check!) when you plug in the the transceiver.

## Dependencies installation##
```
#!shell

git clone https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/fzi_icl_core.git
git clone https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/fzi_icl_can.git
git clone https://github.com/matkok/schunk_canopen_driver.git (difference in SchunkPowerBallNode.cpp, no call for CommutationCalibrated())

catkin_make_isolated
source devel_isolated/setup.bash
rosrun fzi_icl_can install_pcan_module.sh

```

After  that you can delete folders fzi_icl_core and fzi_icl_can from /src and do "catkin_make" and source "devel/setup.bash".
